For brand identity, I inspected the official CitiBike website to get the colour palette:
* Red: #ed2e14

## Workbook

Disclaimer: It was requested the workbook to be submitted workbook as a `.twbx` file format but I could not find the "save as .twbx" option in the file dropdown Tableau menu. 

## Analysis

In July 2022 the CitiBike service was used 3.5 million times, most of them members. Nearly 840 thousand were casual users, about 25%. 

The biggest difference that can be observed between the two types of users is that all docked bikes were rented by casual users.

In addition, the most used stations are all located in the heart of New York City, with a clear focus on Central Park.

The busiest and the most popular station in the city, both as a start and end station, is the one located at West St. & Chambers St.

## Background

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so my main task on the job was to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.
